### Main Results

The main results of this project is that many restaurants in New York City are not very clean.
As talked about in the process book, on average a restaurant will receive a critical violaiton on
over 50% of its inspections! A critical violation is a violation most likely to contribute to food-borne
illness. We also looked at popular fast food places, Dunkin, Subway, McDonalds, Starbucks and Domino's. 
We found that these places have a lot of critical violations. We looked at the top 6 critical violations, and
looked at how common they were at each of these places using a grouped bar chart. We found that about 11% of 
McDonald's inspections in New York City found filth flies! Also, at Subway over 10% of inspections found that a
food contact surface was not properly washed. These are not great results, and we would like our visualization to
inform the public of just how dirty New York City Restaurants may be.

Interface Explanation
---
The map has two options buttons that can be selected. The map will show the data it is displaying on mouseover. It can also be zoomed and panned. The charts will show additional info on mouseover. Clicking the bars will change what is displayed on the map, and clikcing the same bar again will return the map to the previous configuration. On the lower left chart the title is a dropdown menu with two selections, and hovering over the info marker gives an explanation of the data.

As a note - the files containing the information needed to draw the map are large, and so the map may take a few seconds to load in.

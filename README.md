Work done for Earth Genome in the second half of 2024, in partnership with Conservation International. I developed an AI-powered chat tool designed to make CI's environmental research more accessible to policymakers, educators, and the public. I focused on designing prompt architectures, agent chaining logic, and user personas that translate dense scientific material into clear, grounded responses with citation links. The system allows for natural language interaction with over 100 research papers and tailors outputs by audience needs. I also experimented with agentic architecture in the "prompt-to-map" tool used for generating tools from Mapbiomas data (the code for which is in this repo, but it is not a tool currently deployed on the website). This project demonstrates my ability to create mission-aligned, user-centered AI tools that operationalize complex data.


## Academic front-end mapping tools (JavaScript, D3, GeoJSON)

### NYC Health violations map

Developed in 2019 as a demonstration of creating maps using D3. Examines the NYC health violations data at different levels across the city. GeoJSON is used to generate the map, and D3 with vanilla JS are used to compute data across different aggregations across the map.

### Global CO2 emissions maps

Developed in 2019 as a demonstration of creating maps using D3. Also uses GeoJSON data to generate the map, and explores spatial data showing the carbon emissions in total and per capita across the world. A slider allows for examining data trends across time.

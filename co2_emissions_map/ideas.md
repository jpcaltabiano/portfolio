### CO2 Emmissions from 1971-2014
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/alr6jt/countries_scaled_by_total_co2_emissions_1971_to/

Encode pure emissions by color on country and use slider to naviagte through time
How to encode emmissions per capita? Mouseover?
Maybe bivariate chloropleth, but looks sloppy https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2018/2/how-make-effective-bivariate-choropleth-maps-tableau-83121
Or use supplemental chart underneath?

Be able to select a country and see a line chart of the emissions over the years. 
Would have to be able to change the y axis scale on the fly. Can do this automatically with that specific data series, see scatterplot homework

Slider has a color gradient which represents the total emissons for each year

Color scale - some countries go from 100 to 400, others go from 5mil to 10mil. What is the best way to show this with color...?
Is it more important for people to see who the greatest polluters are compared to all countries, or to see the change in 
pollution over time? Would it be misleading to have each country colored on its own scale to show change over time?
-- Use buckets like a histogram? Encode one color shade per 1000 or 10000 increase?
